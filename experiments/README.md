## Module: Experiments

The `experiments` module enables you to reproduce the deepfake detection experiments reported in our paper. These experiments are divided into two main categories:

- **Audio Experiments**: Located in `experiments/audio_experiments/`, this folder contains experiments focused on audio-based deepfake detection.
- **Video Experiments**: Located in `experiments/video_experiments/`, this folder contains experiments focused on video-based deepfake detection.

### Environment Setup

Each subfolder within `audio_experiments/` and `video_experiments/` has its own specific environment and dependencies. It is important to refer to the respective `README.md` files in each subfolder for detailed instructions on setting up the environment and running the experiments.
